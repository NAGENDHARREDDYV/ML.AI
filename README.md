Our solution statement :

"Use the ML workflow to process and transform PIMA indian diabetes data to create a prediciton model". This model must predict which people are likely to develop diabetes with 70% or greater accuracy.

- Based on Diabetes data from Pima Indian data, we need to train our model to predict is a patient is diabetes or not.
